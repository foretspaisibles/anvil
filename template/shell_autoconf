Description: A shell script with autoconf directory names

### ${ANVIL_FILENAME} -- ${ANVIL_DESCRIPTION}

# ${ANVIL_LICENSE_BLOB}


### SYNOPSIS

# : ${subrdir:?}
# . "${subrdir}/${ANVIL_FILENAME}"

# We implement symbolic directory names following the GNU coding
# standards.  Most of the comments are citations from the GNU coding
# standards:

#   The GNU coding standards, last updated September 13, 2013.

### IMPLEMENTATION

# These first two variables set the root for the installation. All the
# other installation directories should be subdirectories of one of
# these two, and nothing should be directly installed into these two
# directories.

PACKAGE='${ANVIL_PACKAGE}'


# prefix
#  Installation prefix for machine independant files
: ${prefix:=/usr/local}


# exec_prefix
#  Installation prefix for machine dependant data
: ${exec_prefix:=${prefix}}


# bindir

# datadir
#  Destination of idiosyncratic read-only architecture-independent data files
: ${datadir:=${prefix}/share/${PACKAGE}}
